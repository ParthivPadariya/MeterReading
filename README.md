# MeterReading
The "Reading Meter and Pay" app is a mobile application that enables users to easily read 
their electric meter using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology and pay their 
electricity bills directly from their mobile devices. With this app, users no longer need to 
manually read their meters or visit their utility providers' offices to pay their bills. The app 
utilizes the smartphone's camera to capture an image of the electric meter, and then uses OCR 
to recognize the meter readings. The recognized readings are then displayed to the user for 
verification before being used to calculate the electricity bill. The app also provides users 
with the option to pay their bills using various payment methods such as credit/debit cards, 
net banking, or mobile wallets. The app can be used by both residential and commercial 
customers, allowing them to easily manage their electricity bills without the need for paper 
bills or manual meter readings. This can lead to significant cost savings for electricity 
providers, as well as increased convenience and satisfaction for customers. The OCR 
technology used in the app is highly accurate, allowing for reliable meter readings and 
reducing the risk of billing errors. The app also uses machine learning algorithms to improve 
its accuracy over time, ensuring that it becomes even more effective with continued use. In 
addition to facilitating bill payments, the app provides users with real-time information about 
their electricity consumption, allowing them to monitor their usage and make adjustments to 
reduce their energy consumption and save money. Overall, the "Reading Meter and Pay" app 
offers a convenient and efficient way for users to manage their electricity bills, saving them 
time and effort while ensuring accurate readings and secure payments.
